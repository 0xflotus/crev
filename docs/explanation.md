`crev` is a real "code review" system as opposed to typical "code-change review" system.

`crev` records review metadata: who, when, how did the review and 
stores this information in a verifiable way along with the code.

`crev` starts at a file granularity, builds on top of it upwards, allowing
spontaneous coordination and trust building on a personal, project, and global
scale.
